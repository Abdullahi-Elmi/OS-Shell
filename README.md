# OS-Shell

Building an OS Shell where we:
- can simulate the kernel run-time environment, which includes the PCB, the ready queue, the CPU, and a simple memory. 
- implement an OS Boot sequence, and a memory manager to handle memory allocation
- build a non-contiguous file system (disk, drivers, I/O scheduler)
